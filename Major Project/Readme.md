# Personal To-Do List Application

## Project Overview
This is a simple Personal To-Do List Application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application includes functionality for adding, viewing, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. It uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with Tkinter and stores tasks persistently in a **JSON file**.

### Key Features
- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks with a title, description, and category. They can also mark tasks as completed or delete them.
- **Categorization**: Tasks can be categorized (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file, which ensures that user progress is saved between sessions.
- **Graphical Interface**: The application provides a simple and easy-to-use interface using Tkinter.

## How to Run the Application
